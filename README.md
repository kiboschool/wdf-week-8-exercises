# Week 8 Exercises

This week, the mandatory exercises are:

1. **Click Counter**:In this exercise, you are going to count the number of times the user has clicked a given button on a website

1. **Hide the Bunny**: In this task, you would make the image of a bunny disappear when the user clicks a given button.


1. **Kibo Slide Show**: Did you could build a slide show using HTML, CSS  and JavaScript, get into this exercise to find out how.

1. **Profile Page**: In this project, you'll be adding JavaScript to your profile page to make it interactive. You're going to implement a toggle, so that when a visitor clicks on one of your headings, the paragraph text is displayed.

## Testing

1. Navigate your terminal to the parent exercise folder for the week (not the individual exercise).

1. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`

1. To run all tests for the week, run `npm run test`

1. To run the test for a specific exercise, you need to specify the path to the exercise folder, run `npm run test exercise-folder`. For example, run `npm run test chicken-peanut-stew`

<!-- To check that your solution meets the criteria, run `npm run test` in the console. (If you haven't already, you'll need to run `npm install` to install the packages required for testing). -->

If your solution has all the required elements it should say something like:

```txt
 PASS  ./html-elements.test.js
  The recipe page has the required HTML elements
    ✓ uses at least one heading element (50 ms)
    ✓ uses at least three heading elements (18 ms)
    ✓ uses at least two heading elements (10 ms)
    ✓ uses at least one image element (5 ms)
    ✓ index.html is a valid html doc (193 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       5 passed, 5 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.104 s
Ran all test suites.
```

If it does not pass one of the tests, you should get some feedback about what is wrong or missing in your solution.

### Valid HTML

The last test for each exercise is that your HTML follows all of the recommended rules for an HTML document.

[Here is a list](https://html-validate.org/rules/index.html) of all the rules that will be automatically checked. You don't have to memorize this list or check each rule yourself. Instead, if you get feedback that your HTML breaks one of the rules, you can find an explanation of the rule from that list.

Once you have passed all tests for the week, then you are ready to submit to Gradescope.

## Submission
