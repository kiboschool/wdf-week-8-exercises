# Week 8 Exercises

This week, the mandatory exercises are:

1. **Click Counter**: In this exercise, you'll work on a site that should count the number of times the user has clicked the button. 

2. **Hide the Bunny** Make the image of a bunny disappear when the user clicks a button.

3. **Kibo Slide Show**: Build a slideshow using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To solve each exercise, navigate to the exercise folder and follow the instructions in the README.md file.

## Testing

You can use the automated tests to check that your work is valid.

1. Navigate your terminal to the parent exercise folder for the week (not the individual exercise).

2. Install the project dependencies by running `pnpm install`

3. To run all tests for the week, run `pnpm run test`

4. To run the test for a specific exercise, you need to specify the path to the exercise folder, run `pnpm run test exercise-folder`. For example, run `pnpm run test chicken-peanut-stew`

If your solution has all the required elements it should say something like:

```txt
 PASS  ./html-elements.test.js
  The recipe page has the required HTML elements
    ✓ uses at least one heading element (50 ms)
    ✓ uses at least three heading elements (18 ms)
    ✓ uses at least two heading elements (10 ms)
    ✓ uses at least one image element (5 ms)
    ✓ index.html is a valid html doc (193 ms)
