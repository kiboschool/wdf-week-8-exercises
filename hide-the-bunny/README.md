# Hide on click

Make the image of the bunny disappear when the user clicks the button.

## Instructions

Add code to hide the bunny when clicked.

Practice testing snippets of code in the Console, then copying and pasting them into `script.js` when they are semi-working.

* To start, use `querySelector` to find the button
* Add an event listener to the button that runs `console.log("clicked")` when the button is clicked
* Create a CSS class called `hidden` in `style.css`. In the HTML file, add the class to the image to confirm that the styles work. Then remove the class from the HTML.
* In the Console, select the `img` tag using `document.querySelector`
* Try adding the `hidden` class to the image in the Console
* Once you have the code to hide the image working, copy it to the event listener on the button.

Check that your code works by running it all together. The bunny should disappear when the button is clicked.
